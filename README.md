# Treblle CLI

API Insights scores your API using over 30 tests taken from standards and industry best practices across three categories:

- **Design**: how well your API is structured. Is it a well-crafted ship, ready to withstand the rough seas of user demands and scalability?

- **Performance**: does your API respond quickly? It's like checking the wind in your sails â€“ are you moving swiftly and smoothly?

- **Security**: how safe and secure is your API? It's akin to having a strong hull to protect against the stormy seas of cyber threats.
